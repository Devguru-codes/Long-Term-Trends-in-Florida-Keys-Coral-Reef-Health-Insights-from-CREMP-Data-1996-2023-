🧭 Overview
This repository contains the comprehensive report “Florida Keys Coral Reef Health Assessment: An Analysis of CREMP Data (1996–2023)”, presenting a nearly 30-year assessment of coral reef conditions in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

The study explores ecological trends in:

Stony coral cover

Species richness

Octocoral (soft coral) density

Living tissue area (LTA)
Alongside the role of environmental drivers such as temperature and geographic location.

The report is crafted to be accessible for scientists, conservationists, policy-makers, and the general public, translating complex data into actionable insights.

📂 Data Sources
Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP):
Long-term monitoring data from 1996 to 2023

Study Area:
Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary

📌 Key Findings
1. Stony Coral Cover
Notable decline since 1996

Substantial variability across stations and sites

Some dominant species experienced sharper reductions

2. Species Richness
Fluctuates yearly with no consistent long-term trend

Marked spatial differences across EPA segments

3. Octocoral Density
Increasing trend observed (2011–2022)

Contrasts with declining stony corals

High interannual variability

4. Living Tissue Area (LTA)
Significant variation across locations

Overall decline from 2011 to 2023

5. Spatial Patterns
Clustering detected via Moran’s I and Gi*:

High and low zones of coral cover and richness

Hotspots and coldspots identified

6. Key Drivers & Interactions
Positive link between coral cover and species richness

Octocoral density correlates with temperature

Richness variability may act as an early warning signal

Some sites show greater LTA sensitivity to temperature anomalies

7. Regional Comparisons
Differences observed across:

Upper Keys (UK)

Middle Keys (MK)

Lower Keys (LK)

8. Future Outlook (Projections)
Prophet time-series models forecast:

Continued mild decline or stabilization in coral cover and richness

Increasing uncertainty with longer projections
